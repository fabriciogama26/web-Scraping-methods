Structure of Scraping Functions

The structure of the requests-HTML parsing call goes like this:

variable.attribute.function(*selector*, parameters)

The variable is the instance that you created using the .get(url) function.

The attribute is the type of content that you want to extract (html / lxml).

The requests-HTML parser also has many useful built-in methods for SEOs.

    links: Get all links found on a page (anchors included);
    absolute_links: Get all links found on a page (anchors excluded);
    find(): Find a specific element on a page with a CSS Selector;
    xpath(): Get elements using Xpath function;
